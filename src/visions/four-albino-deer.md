four albino deer!

"Space babe, please listen to our tragic tale. On the fourth day of Christmas, True Love was supposed to gift us! US you see, not some four calling birds. The song would've been sung for the ages: 'On the fourth day of Christmas my true love gave to me: four albino deer, three French hens, two turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear tree!' But alas, fresh snow fell on the third night of Christmas and in the morning True Love could not see us against the white field. So we were passed over... Babe, if you ever find True Love in your space travels, please tell them we forgive them.... forgive but never forget........"
