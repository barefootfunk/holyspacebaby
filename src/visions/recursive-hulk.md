RecursiveHulk.  It is at this moment that the space babe notices that it has never seen its own nose directly.  Maybe a blurry shape vaguely visible in the center of vision, maybe a reflection from a mirror, but never a direct view.  Perhaps if the babe looked directly at its own nose it would see another babe.  Are we all RecursiveHulk but just cannot see our true nature?\

"Help!" yells RecursiveHulk. "I am drowning in Me's!"
