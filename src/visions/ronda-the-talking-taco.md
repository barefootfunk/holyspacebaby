Ronda the Talking Taco.  She trembles with anxiety from time to time for she feels she is never enough.  "Nobody will ever love a taco," she repeats to herself.  "I'll be alone forever."  She hyperventilates at the thought.  

Yet still, she gets up early every day and spends hours arranging her cheese and salsa, and picking out the perfect shell.  "Hmmm, I think today is a softshell kind of day." Ronda, despite all of her deepest fears, still puts one foot in front of the other.  "I have to believe I'm wrong.  Maybe today will be the day I find love.  Some man or woman (or horse) that loves me for ME.  Even though I'm a talking taco. NO.  BECAUSE I'm a talking taco." She pulls herself together.  "I'll never know if I don't put myself out there and try my best."
