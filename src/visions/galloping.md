a horse named Arnold galloping at full speed to meet his true love Ronda.  He does not know that Ronda is a talking taco.  For you see, they met on Bumble and Ronda was pretending to be a horse because she has made a career of catfishing young ponies.  But, their conversations were so deep, so intimate.  Arnold fell deeply in love and Ronda, despite her best efforts, began to love this horse back.  They could put off meeting no longer.  But Ronda is terrified.  Will Arnold accept her still after discovering that she is a talking taco?  She sobs to herself, for she fears he will not.  She'd rather have never felt a love this deep in the first place, than lose it.
