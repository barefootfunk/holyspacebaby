the demon Bael in his infernal form!! He scuttles towards the babe on all eight legs. "Why hello there sweet babe," the cat, the king, and the toad chime in unison. 

"Could you spare a kidney for an old king? I will grant you the power of invisibility in exchange," the king says. 

"Kidneys disagree with my digestion," says the toad. "How about a finger instead? I do love pinkies. I will grant you command of one of my sixty-six demonic legions in exchange!" 

"How vulgar," said the cat. "Dear babe, I ask only for an eyelash. In exchange I will give you true love." 

"No!" cried the king. "Please babe, you are my singular and therefore most loyal subject - "

The babe pauses, pondering the options Bael has presented. Does it accept one of these offers? Does it barter? Does it drift on in search of other incongruent exchanges in the transactional universe?
