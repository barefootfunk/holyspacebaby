a silent universe of empty white void save but a single green chair in the distance.  The babe hears a voice emanating from the chair:

Hello little one! Have a seat! You have nothing to fear.  You are not in any grave danger. Who gave you that idea?  How silly.  Wouldn't a seat be nice?  I am so velvety silky soft and you are so, so weary.  Have a nap.  I promise not to absorb you. 

Does the babe trust this chair?
