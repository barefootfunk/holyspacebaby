the pear king.

"SEE HEAR! My pears are the most delicious in all of the multiverse. I have made them each mathematically perfect.  DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH SKILL IT REQUIRES TO SYNTHESIZE PEAR PERFECTION WITH MATHEMATICS? I AM A GOD TO YOU.

"I dare you, insolent fool, to feast upon my pears and cry not a tear. Despair! For the pear flesh upon your tongue will be the pinnacle of your life's mountain.  From there you can only fall.  You will know this. The pear will pass from you in due time, and you will die one dayâ€“cold and pearless."
